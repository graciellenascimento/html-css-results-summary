## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this challenge, I was able to learn about variable fonts; a concept I didn't really knew. It was really nice gaining this knowledge and I'm sure it may help a lot in the future. Also, it didn't worked out at the beginning, but when everything went ok and I was able to see the font, it was fun.
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Hanken Grotesk';
    src: url('/assets/fonts/HankenGrotesk-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format("truetype-variations");
    font-weight: 1 999;
}
```

### Continued development
In the future, I want and will explore a mobile-first solution, as I tried it before and was indeed helpful (although it was not used here).
